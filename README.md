# Convert To JSON
Take a single file in either CSV or YAML format and convert it to JSON format. To keep this simple for users it will create the same filename but with a .json extension. 

### On the command line

./convert_to_json.rb myfile.csv

or

./convert_to_json.rb myfile.yaml

Produces:

myfile.json
